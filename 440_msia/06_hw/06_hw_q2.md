## Protection Level and Booking Limit Calculation

### Problem Statement
An airline offers two fare classes for coach seats on a particular flight: full-fare class at \$440/ticket and economy class at \$218/ticket. There are 230 coach seats on the aircraft. The demand for full-fare seats has an empirical distribution with a mean of 43 and a standard deviation of 8.

### a) Calculation of Protection Level and Booking Limit for Low-fare Seats

1. **Critical Fractile Calculation**:
   The critical fractile is calculated using the formula:
   
   $q = F^{-1}\left(\frac{p-c}{p}\right)$
   
   Where $p$ is the full-fare price, $c$ is the economy fare price, and $F^{-1}$ represents the inverse of the cumulative distribution function of the demand.
   
   Given that $p = \$440$ and $c = \$218$, we compute the critical fractile as:
   
   $Critical\ Fractile = \frac{440 - 218}{440} \approx 0.505$
   
2. **Protection Level**:
   By comparing the critical fractile with the empirical distribution, we determine the protection level $Q^*$ as the full-fare demand $Q$ at the smallest cumulative probability greater than or equal to the critical fractile.
   
   Protection Level (Q^*): `46`

3. **Booking Limit for Economy Seats**:
   The booking limit for economy seats (BL) is calculated as the total number of coach seats minus the protection level.
   
   Booking Limit (BL): `184`

### b) Impact of Last-minute Discounted Sales on Protection Level

- **Expectation**: The protection level $Q^*$ is expected to be **Higher**.
- **Justification**: The opportunity to sell unsold seats at the last minute at a reduced rate reduces the opportunity cost of reserving a seat for a full-fare customer. This can potentially increase the protection level since the risk of a seat remaining unsold is mitigated by the possibility of last-minute sales.
