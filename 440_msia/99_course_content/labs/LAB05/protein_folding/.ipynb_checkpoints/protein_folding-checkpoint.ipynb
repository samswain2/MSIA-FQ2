    "The problem described in this Jupyter Notebook is based on a molecular biology problem that is discussed in a paper entitled “Quadratic Binary Programming Models in Computational Biology” by Forrester and Greenberg (2008). The problem pertains to a protein, which consists of a chain of amino acids. In this problem, the amino acids come in two forms: hydrophilic (waterloving) and hydrophobic (water hating). An example of such a chain is given in the following figure with the hydrophobic acids marked in bold.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Such a chain naturally folds so as to bring as many hydrophobic acids as possible close together. A folding for the chain, in two dimensions, is given in the following figure, with the new matches marked by dashed lines. Our objective is to predict the optimum folding.\n",
